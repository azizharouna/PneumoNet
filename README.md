# PneumoNet: Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

PneumoNet is a deep learning project aimed at detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with PyTorch. This project covers the entire workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and deployment as a web application.

## Introduction

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages deep learning techniques to build a model that can classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia-positive or pneumonia-negative.

## Google Colab Setup

Given the large dataset size (~2 GB), it is recommended to use Google Colab for running the notebooks. Colab provides free compute resources and sufficient storage to handle the dataset.

**Download the Dataset:**
   - Use the provided `download_data.py` script or Kaggle API to download the dataset directly into Colab's environment or your Google Drive.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. It contains labeled X-ray images of patients with and without pneumonia.

### Dataset Structure:

```plaintext

├── raw/                # Original dataset files
├── processed/          # Preprocessed data (train, validation, and test sets)
└── README.md           # Instructions on data acquisition and processing
```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Preprocess the data:**
   Run the `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab to load, explore, and preprocess the dataset, including data augmentation techniques.

2. **Split the data:**
   The notebook splits the data into training, validation, and test sets, and stores the processed data in the `data/processed/` directory or Google Drive.

### Model Training

1. **Train the model:**
   Open and run the `02_model_training.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab to design the CNN architecture, set up the training loop, and train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

2. **Save the model:**
   The trained model can be saved in your Google Drive for later evaluation and re-deployment.

### Model Evaluation

1. **Evaluate the model:**
   Use the `03_model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook to evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, is documented in the `03_model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook. Example predictions and visualizations are also provided.
